# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: set the basics for the new layout for ryanmagoon.com using sketch and then html + css.

**Thoughts** : I wanted to make this really minimal. I don't know if that will affect my credibility, but I wanted my work to speak for itself in the portfolio section. That being said, I'll probably spend some time later polishing things once I have some portfolio pieces that I'm more proud of.

### Day 2: Sunday January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: do revisions on my ryanmagoon.com layout

**Thoughts** : I wanted to throw some more personality into my layout. I've got most of the structure worked out. Hopefully I can get all the content written and laid out and then push it out either tomorrow or the next day.
