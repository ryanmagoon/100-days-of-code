# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: set the basics for the new layout for ryanmagoon.com using sketch and then html + css.

**Thoughts** : I wanted to make this really minimal. I don't know if that will affect my credibility, but I wanted y work to speak for itself in the portfolio section. That being said, I'll probably spend some time later polishing things once I have some portfolio pieces that I'm more proud of.
